This is Deluge Front Server. This application is meant to simplify adding torrent files to the Deluge torrent client via the web. The point of the application is for it to be ridiculously simple, hence why it simply consists of a textbox and a button. The text box being where you put the HTTP link to the torrent file. The button being how you begin downloading that torrent via Deluge.
